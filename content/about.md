Hi I'm Chris and welcome to my site!

I am currently a junior security consultant with a passion in cyber security and software development.

I am dedicated to helping people secure their applications so that they can continue to develop the best software they can without fear.

Having worked as a software developer, I enjoy the creative side of software development and building amazing applications with real world implications.

I strive to be approachable, friendly and reliable. 

I enjoy attending technology meet ups and events to socialise and expand my knowledge base. I am also looking to contribute back by doing some talks myself one day.

Outside of work I enjoy testing out new and emerging technologies, working on personal software projects as well as a bit of casual gaming.

I also enjoy the relaxation of kayaking on the lake.
